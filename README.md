# Port-Update-2

I used a html template layout. If it is not okay, I can upload the original portfolio I updated that one just incase this one was not allowed. 

FYI I am not planning on applying for jobs right away, this bootcamp only allowed me to scratch the surface, I have more studying to do before I feel like I am ready to apply for jobs. 

I have included 4 homework assignments, 2 projects with the website as well as the link to github
I included working links to facebook, linked-in and git hub
